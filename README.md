# Chaldean-Oracles---RNN
Using an RNN to generate new text from the enigmatic Chaldean Oracles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldean_Oracles).

 Much scholarly ink has been spilled trying to interpret and tease out coherent dogmas from the preserved fragments of these oracles, but what if they are random conglomerations of philosophical concepts a la the Abulafia experiments in Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault%27s_Pendulum)? Could a decently trained RNN generate convincing Chaldean Oracles?
